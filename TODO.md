- is the action to set the viewport height necessary?
- get rid of link like team:TOR or player:2131, use enum types, the whole FocusableId vs LinkTarget thing is redundant
- leverage the usage of Document::group
- would boxchar be better as single chars instead of string
- scorebox: postponed game?
- rename boxscore stuff to gamedetail?
